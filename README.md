### Instructions for myself lol:

- `package.json` has all of the scripts and dependencies.
- If on a new setup, first make sure node and npm are installed. Then run `npm install`.
- `npm run serve-watch` should work.
- Since you've used so much Mercurial, the basic flow for git is `git add .` and `git commit`. `git commit --amend` works too.
- Then `git push` should work.
